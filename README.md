# work-day-scheduler

## Description
- Motivation to build a work day scheduler was based on the past couple of classes. Classes were taught on Javascript and JQuery and the behind tools of how Javascript and JQuery can make a website interactive.
- I built the work day scheduler to take what I've learned these past couple of days during bootcamp. We learned that we can have Javascript call a function and execute said function to make a tool based on the needs a person might have. Also implement JQuery and using DAYJS to add dates without having to create the function for it.
- This project solves the problem if you need to organize your workday by hours and schedule tasks and deadlines.
- I learned that Javascript and JQuery allows your website/tool to function. It takes your variables and applies them to functions and executes the functions based on your needs which is defined in the if and else if statements.

## Usage
- How to use the work day scheduler
- Type task/deadline for the hour you need to complete by.
- Click the save button.
- Task/deadline will be saved.
- You can come back later in the day to the page and your task will still be there
- See screenshot below as example
